# 3D Urban Dashboard
### By: Dylan Rylee Dizon

An interactive 3D city‑block viewer for Calgary (or NYC by default) that lets you:

- Fetch building footprints, heights, zoning & more via open‑data APIs  
- Extrude & render them in Three.js  
- Click to highlight & show details  
- Run natural‑language filters powered by Google Gemini (or HF LLM)  
- Save/load/delete “projects” (filter‑sets) in SQLite
